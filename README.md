## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Java 17** or higher
- **PostgreSQL** installed locally or on a server
- **Gradle** build tool

### Database Setup

1. Set up a PostgreSQL database. Use the following credentials in your `application.properties` file or customize them:

    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/investmenttracker
    spring.datasource.username=postgres
    spring.datasource.password=your_password
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
    ```

2. Ensure that the necessary database tables are created automatically by Hibernate based on the application's data model.

### Running the Application

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/InvestmentTrackerApp.git
    cd InvestmentTrackerApp
    ```

2. Build and run the project using Gradle:

    ```bash
    ./gradlew bootRun
    ```

3. Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

## API Integration

To integrate with external APIs for real-time stock prices, update the API key in the `APIConstants` class:

```java
public class APIConstants {
    public static final String API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
}
```
Note: The basic version of the app (without a premium account) supports a maximum of 5 requests per minute.
